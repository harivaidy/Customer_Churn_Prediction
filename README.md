# Customer_Churn_Prediction
This repository contains a project that aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company.
Customer churn refers to the loss of customers due to cancellation or non-renewal of services, and it is a critical metric for businesses to monitor and manage.

The project includes the following components:

Data exploration and preparation: This includes loading and cleaning the data, visualizing and summarizing the data, and performing feature engineering to create new features that are informative for churn prediction.

Model development and evaluation: This includes training and tuning the XGBoost model, evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and interpreting the results to gain insights into the factors that contribute to churn.
